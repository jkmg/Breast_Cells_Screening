### Screening of cell tissue is extremely important to detect tumors. This dataset contains measurements of cell properties derived from a digitalised image of cell nuclei of breast cells for 569 samples. Each sample also contains a diagnosis as benign or malignant. In particular, the dataset breastdata.txt contains the variables listed below. 

#### - ID: ID of the register
#### - Diagnosis: M = malignant, B = benign
#### - Radius: mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
#### - Texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values
#### - Perimeter: Average perimeter of nuclei
#### - Area: Average area of nuclei
#### - Smoothness: local variation in radius lengths
#### - Compactness: Average of perimeter 2 / area - 1.0
#### - Concavity: average severity of concave portions of the contour
#### - Concave points: average number of concave portions of the contour
#### - Symmetry: average symmetry measure of nuclei
#### - Fractal dimension: ”coastline approximation” – 1
